# break-code
Mastermind: A code guessing game. Try to guess the 4 color combo using a selection of 6. Typically a two-player game, with player 1 making the code in secret and giving player two feedback while player two guesses. This is a single player game.

JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Would like to add a stickbug animation when they lose, round off some edges, make the game stretch less, add in mobile sizing and selections options.
