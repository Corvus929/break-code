# break-code
Mastermind: A code guessing game. Try to guess the 4 color combo using a selection of 6. Typically a two-player game, with player 1 making the code in secret and giving player two feedback while player two guesses. This is a single player game.

Would like to add a stickbug animation when they lose, round off some edges, make the game stretch less, add in mobile sizing and selections options.![Screenshot_20230209_023127](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123399341/217954284-48bc3b7b-a1d2-4d75-bcb2-8d8511edf06b.png)
