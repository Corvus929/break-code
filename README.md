# break-code
Mastermind: A code guessing game. Try to guess the 4 color combo using a selection of 6. Typically a two-player game, with player 1 making the code in secret and giving player two feedback while player two guesses. This is a single player game.

JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Would like to add a stickbug animation when they lose, round off some edges, make the game stretch less, add in mobile sizing and selections options. Less lives, make the results appear at random to make it harder.
